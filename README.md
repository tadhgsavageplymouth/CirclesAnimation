# The Social Bubble

The Social Bubble is an interactive web visualization that showcases YouTube video data, hashtag relationships, and more, using dynamically animated bubbles. Each "bubble" represents various metrics such as view counts and growth rates over time. The project is created using **p5.js** to render animations and visualize data on a responsive HTML page.

## Project Overview

The Social Bubble is designed to make data exploration engaging by using animations. Four visualizations (animations) are available:

1. **Animation 1**: Bubbles that grow based on YouTube view counts and video length.
2. **Animation 2**: Growth rate of bubbles based on view count and recency.
3. **Animation 3**: Interacting circles representing different metrics that grow and collide to create new bubbles.
4. **Animation 4**: View growth over time represented by growing and moving bubbles, showing view count changes dynamically.

## Technologies

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling for a cohesive and engaging design.
- **JavaScript (p5.js)**: Used for animations and dynamic data visualization.
