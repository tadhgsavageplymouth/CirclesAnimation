Python Preprocessing Script (minors.py upgrade)
Goal: Dynamically extract and analyze hashtags from real video data.

âœ… Reads a CSV with video details (title, description, views).

âœ… Extracts hashtags from title + description.

âœ… Calculates:

Total views per hashtag (viewCountSum)

Number of videos using each hashtag (videoCount)

Hashtag co-occurrence links (when hashtags appear together)

âœ… Outputs JSON with this structure for each hashtag:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "hashtag": "#example",
  "viewCountSum": 150000,
  "videoCount": 3,
  "links": ["#another"]
}
ðŸŽ¨ 2. JavaScript Visualisation (script5.js refactor)
Goal: Visualize hashtags and their relationships more meaningfully.

âœ… Loads the generated JSON of hashtags.

âœ… Each hashtag becomes a node, sized by average views and colored randomly.

âœ… Links (edges) are drawn between hashtags that co-occurred in videos.

âœ… Hover tooltips show detailed data (views, count).

âœ… More dynamic, data-driven, and interactive network.

This upgrade makes your visualization automatically reflect real trends in your dataset, with richer interconnections between hashtags based on how theyâ€™re actually used.
